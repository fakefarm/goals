<h1>About</h1>
<p>My main goal is to learn <a href="http://www.angularjs.org">Angular</a>.</p>
<h2>Why Goalies</h2>
<p>For years, I've been setting goals with a spreadsheet that helps calculate various stats like the amount of time per goal, balancing life cateories, etc. I think Angular can help me convert it from a spreadsheet to a web app.</p>
